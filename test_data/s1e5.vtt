There's an unofficial company

that if there was
a serious criminal incident,

we would sail to so-called
"friendly" authorities.

00:08:38.518 --> 00:08:39.842
Were you involved in that?

162
00:08:39.852 --> 00:08:40.890
Yes.

163
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:44.925
- (ELEVATOR DINGS)
- Yes, I was.

164
00:08:44.935 --> 00:08:48.228
So, I met the guy. Sylvester.

165
00:08:48.239 --> 00:08:49.256
Sylvester?

166
00:08:49.267 --> 00:08:50.467
Did you use a fake name?

167
00:08:50.477 --> 00:08:53.300
Uh, I think Sylvester's his real name.

168
00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:55.133
Who's called Sylvester?

169
00:08:55.143 --> 00:08:57.842
He's just, we pay him,
he's normal, he's legit,

170
00:08:57.852 --> 00:08:59.508
he's on the record... he says it's easy.

171
00:08:59.518 --> 00:09:01.592
He's gonna shred
this cruise problem away.

172
00:09:01.602 --> 00:09:03.592
OK. Well, I'm worried.

173
00:09:03.602 --> 00:09:07.175
Did you know that after
the Iranian revolution,

174
00:09:07.185 --> 00:09:09.258
the students, they taped back together

175
00:09:09.268 --> 00:09:11.425
the shredded documents
from the US embassy?

176
00:09:11.435 --> 00:09:13.133
Did you know about that?

177
00:09:13.143 --> 00:09:16.091
Uh, he asked a lot
about the digital deep clean,

178
00:09:16.101 --> 00:09:18.759
and I said that was good,
emails and servers,

179
00:09:18.769 --> 00:09:20.759
nice and general, not specific.

180
00:09:20.769 --> 00:09:23.175
But, um, of course
we'd wiped the specifics.

181
00:09:23.185 --> 00:09:24.800
Great. So how does this part work?

182
00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:26.508
- OK. We shred...
- Yeah?

183
00:09:26.518 --> 00:09:28.633
then some guys come in when we're quiet,

184
00:09:28.643 --> 00:09:31.300
he suggests right away,
tomorrow, Thanksgiving,

185
00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:35.800
and, uh... they'll dispose
of the unwanted materials.

186
00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:37.592
We just need someone to shred

187
00:09:37.602 --> 00:09:40.842
and to sign out the materials
from the document depository,

188
00:09:40.852 --> 00:09:43.383
and that name could...
that's a name that could, uh,

189
00:09:43.393 --> 00:09:46.727
draw some heat were things to go... bad.

190
00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:50.925
Well, uh, I can't do it,

191
00:09:50.935 --> 00:09:52.633
obviously, Thanksgiving.

192
00:09:52.643 --> 00:09:54.467
Um, could you?

193
00:09:54.477 --> 00:09:57.467
Uh...

194
00:09:57.477 --> 00:09:58.633
I mean, I could,

195
00:09:58.643 --> 00:10:01.300
it's just, it's, uh, you know,

196
00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:03.091
the task in hand is a little...

197
00:10:03.101 --> 00:10:04.925
No, sure. Absolutely.

198
00:10:04.935 --> 00:10:06.717
You need someone you can trust,

199
00:10:06.727 --> 00:10:09.925
but who is... not expendable...

200
00:10:09.935 --> 00:10:11.717
- That would be horrible.
- Oh, no.

201
00:10:11.727 --> 00:10:13.091
Sure. I get it.

202
00:10:13.101 --> 00:10:15.175
Totally. Totally.

203
00:10:15.185 --> 00:10:18.009
Yeah, it's not as if we'd be
throwing someone under a bus.

204
00:10:18.019 --> 00:10:21.550
It's giving someone
an opportunity to shine.

205
00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:24.091
- Yeah?
- Great.

206
00:10:24.101 --> 00:10:25.101
Yeah.

207
00:10:28.643 --> 00:10:31.009
- Hey, buddy! What's up?
- GREG: Hey, Tom.

208
00:10:31.019 --> 00:10:33.800
What's goin' on? Am I gonna see
you in the office anytime soon?

209
00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:35.717
Uh, not that soon,
I'm actually driving...

210
00:10:35.727 --> 00:10:37.800
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. What's your ETA?

211
00:10:38.715 --> 00:10:41.967
Uh, about 12 hours?
I'm... I'm in Canada.

212
00:10:41.977 --> 00:10:44.075
Excuse me? Canada?

213
00:10:44.086 --> 00:10:46.258
Canada with the healthcare
and the ennui?

214
00:10:46.268 --> 00:10:48.050
Why is that, cock-sock? (CHUCKLES)

215
00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:52.341
Um, I'm driving my grandpa
down for Thanksgiving.

216
00:10:52.351 --> 00:10:53.800
Oh, Greg, fuck your grandpa.

217
00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:56.643
(STAMMERS) You're on speakerphone, Tom!

218
00:10:58.602 --> 00:11:01.009
Well, I shouldn't be, Greg.

219
00:11:01.019 --> 00:11:05.341
I know... I... But I'm
driving, so I can't, like...

220
00:11:05.351 --> 00:11:07.425
So you are. You're still on it.

221
00:11:07.435 --> 00:11:09.884
OK, Greg, so, um, hurry up,

222
00:11:09.894 --> 00:11:11.842
'cause I got a little job
for you, and, uh,

223
00:11:11.852 --> 00:11:14.289
yeah, I'm being nice,
'cause I'm on speakerphone,

224
00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:16.077
but if I wasn't on
speakerphone I'd be being,

225
00:11:16.088 --> 00:11:17.437
shall we say, somewhat less agreeable?

226
00:11:17.448 --> 00:11:18.468
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah?

227
00:11:18.479 --> 00:11:19.935
All right. See ya.

228
00:11:21.518 --> 00:11:23.175
So, yeah... It's good.

229
00:11:23.185 --> 00:11:25.216
It's rough and tumble.

230
00:11:25.226 --> 00:11:27.383
You know? He's, uh,

231
00:11:27.393 --> 00:11:29.383
I call him a dickie, too.

232
00:11:29.393 --> 00:11:32.800
He's pretty lonely, and...
and afraid. I guess.

233
00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:34.467
- (ROMAN GRUNTS)
- Come all the way up.

234
00:11:34.477 --> 00:11:35.925
- Fuck you.
- Come all the way up.

235
00:11:35.935 --> 00:11:37.925
Let's go, come on! Up!

236
00:11:37.935 --> 00:11:39.925
Ah, no! No...

237
00:11:39.935 --> 00:11:41.675
Oh, my God, what the fuck!

238
00:11:41.685 --> 00:11:43.384
I feel like I'm being
pretty fuckin' clear

239
00:11:43.395 --> 00:11:45.425
I need a modicum of space
every 24 hours.

240
00:11:45.435 --> 00:11:47.383
It's your brother.
He absolutely insisted...

241
00:11:47.393 --> 00:11:49.258
Is it true? About the coffee?

242
00:11:49.268 --> 00:11:51.091
Uh, what, Dad?

243
00:11:51.101 --> 00:11:52.185
Can you give us a minute?

244
00:11:53.894 --> 00:11:56.842
Yeah, sure, he kept pouring,
and it just went everywhere.

245
00:11:56.852 --> 00:11:59.592
- Like he didn't even see.
- Jesus. He's not right.

246
00:11:59.602 --> 00:12:01.592
Local TV. Local news.

247
00:12:01.602 --> 00:12:03.759
Here's a news story for you:

248
00:12:03.769 --> 00:12:06.679
Elderly local man doesn't realize
he's getting butt-fucked by Google.

249
00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:09.840
I am not going back to Shanghai. I
saved the company when he was sick.

250
00:12:09.851 --> 00:12:11.341
Did you hear the way he talked to me?

251
00:12:11.351 --> 00:12:13.175
That was his tone the entire
time I was at the studio.

252
00:12:13.185 --> 00:12:15.091
Oh, dude, I know. So patronizing.

253
00:12:15.101 --> 00:12:16.800
Who knows how many people
live in Indonesia?

254
00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:18.564
Who actually gives a shit?
Fuck Indonesia.

255
00:12:18.575 --> 00:12:21.326
- Sounds like a medical condition.
- One of us eventually takes over,

256
00:12:21.337 --> 00:12:24.300
- there's gonna be nothing left.
- Like, how many people live in your ass?

257
00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:26.626
- Rip Van Fucking Asshole.
- It's like the firm's being run

258
00:12:26.637 --> 00:12:28.133
by a compulsive hoarder.

259
00:12:28.143 --> 00:12:31.091
It's this big old, ugly, spooky house,

260
00:12:31.101 --> 00:12:32.842
and he's all caked up in the middle

261
00:12:32.852 --> 00:12:34.383
covered in fucking moldy newspapers

262
00:12:34.393 --> 00:12:35.967
with the local news blaring,

263
00:12:35.977 --> 00:12:38.383
feeding Wonder Bread to raccoons!

264
00:12:38.393 --> 00:12:40.967
Anyway, are you gonna do something?

265
00:12:40.977 --> 00:12:43.175
- I should.
- Yeah, you should.

266
00:12:43.185 --> 00:12:44.967
And the only way he'll respect you

267
00:12:44.977 --> 00:12:46.717
is if you try to destroy him,
because in your position,

268
00:12:46.727 --> 00:12:49.009
that is exactly what he would try to do.

269
00:12:49.019 --> 00:12:51.967
(SIGHS) Yeah.

270
00:12:51.977 --> 00:12:53.592
I can't do that.

271
00:12:53.602 --> 00:12:56.226
Well, obviously, so have fun
in Shanghai.

272
00:12:57.935 --> 00:13:02.216
Work's... Work's goin' OK,
I would say, yup.

273
00:13:02.226 --> 00:13:04.091
Workin' hard.

274
00:13:04.101 --> 00:13:07.091
One of the symptoms of
an approaching nervous breakdown

275
00:13:07.101 --> 00:13:10.009
is the belief that one's "work"

276
00:13:10.019 --> 00:13:13.009
is ever so important.

277
00:13:13.019 --> 00:13:14.592
That's Bertrand Russell.

278
00:13:14.602 --> 00:13:16.967
Huh. Yes, indeed.

279
00:13:16.977 --> 00:13:19.842
Yes... Yes to that.

280
00:13:19.852 --> 00:13:22.592
Um, but I sometimes think,

281
00:13:22.602 --> 00:13:26.009
and I... you know, I know
you're very busy with the ranch

282
00:13:26.019 --> 00:13:28.341
and with you readings and your research,

283
00:13:28.351 --> 00:13:30.216
but I sometimes wonder if one day

284
00:13:30.226 --> 00:13:33.383
you wouldn't be interested in, like...

285
00:13:33.393 --> 00:13:36.967
giving up the seat on the board
and just, like, chilling out,

286
00:13:36.977 --> 00:13:39.383
like, just relaxing, you know?

287
00:13:39.393 --> 00:13:41.550
Life is nothing but a competition

288
00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:44.550
to be the criminal
rather than the victim.

289
00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:45.925
Also Bertrand Russell.

290
00:13:45.935 --> 00:13:48.884
I don't have a Bertrand Russell quote,

291
00:13:48.894 --> 00:13:52.633
because I just... haven't even
heard of him till now,

292
00:13:52.643 --> 00:13:55.508
but, um, but I do have this one.

293
00:13:55.518 --> 00:13:57.518
Just puttin' it out there.

294
00:14:00.643 --> 00:14:01.769
(ELEVATOR DINGS)

295
00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:05.852
Good evening.

296
00:14:06.894 --> 00:14:09.091
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

297
00:14:09.101 --> 00:14:10.467
MARCIA:
How was it?

298
00:14:10.477 --> 00:14:11.800
Ohh. Hi.

299
00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:14.101
- How do you feel?
- Great.

300
00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:17.300
I have some news.

301
00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:20.425
Ewan is definitely
coming to Thanksgiving.

302
00:14:20.435 --> 00:14:22.717
Ewan? Bullshit. Why?

303
00:14:22.727 --> 00:14:25.884
Why? Well, because he asked
and said he'd like to come,

304
00:14:25.894 --> 00:14:27.050
and I said yes.

305
00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:30.592
You're a pretty good liar.

306
00:14:30.602 --> 00:14:33.425
It's not good to have rifts
in the family.

307
00:14:33.435 --> 00:14:36.925
It's not a rift. He lives in
Canada... and he's a prick.

308
00:14:36.935 --> 00:14:39.717
Uh-huh. And how long since you spoke?

309
00:14:39.727 --> 00:14:41.967
We send him a fuckin'
birthday card, don't we?

310
00:14:41.977 --> 00:14:44.133
Not that I get any thanks.

311
00:14:44.143 --> 00:14:47.341
Look, so, we both know
you didn't come back

312
00:14:47.351 --> 00:14:49.175
out of love for my father.

313
00:14:49.185 --> 00:14:54.009
I guess what I wanted to ask
is, um... what's your plan?

314
00:14:54.019 --> 00:14:55.842
Ever hear of loyalty?

315
00:14:55.852 --> 00:14:58.592
Sure. Wasn't he one of the Seven Dwarfs?

316
00:14:58.602 --> 00:15:00.300
- Oh, boy.
- No?

317
00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:02.633

they're not cogent.

It's old man shit.

325
00:15:25.143 --> 00:15:28.091
And, you know,
in some ways that's his call,

326
00:15:28.101 --> 00:15:31.633
but, you know,
he pissed on my fucking floor.

327
00:15:31.643 --> 00:15:35.009
What if that got out?
No one wants to say it,

328
00:15:35.019 --> 00:15:39.175
but, uh. We can because...

329
00:15:39.185 --> 00:15:41.925
basically we love him, but he's not OK.

330
00:15:41.935 --> 00:15:45.009
What about he wakes up one night,

331
00:15:45.019 --> 00:15:48.175
fuckin' calls Bezos,

332
00:15:48.185 --> 00:15:51.175
and sells us out for a dollar?

- Ken...

- I'm an old man.
- He's sick, Frank.

Do you think the real Logan
would want us to stand by

337
00:16:01.101 --> 00:16:02.727
and watch while he throws it all away?

338

Bye. Bye. Bye-bye.

350
00:16:41.268 --> 00:16:44.019
- Is there a problem?
- No, no, it's fine.

351
00:16:46.393 --> 00:16:49.009
- What is it?
- No, it's nothing.

352
00:16:49.019 --> 00:16:51.550
It's just my...
my lawyer was saying that...

353
00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.800
You mean your mom says.

354
00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:57.050
She's a highly respected attorney
in the Twin Cities, Shiv.

355
00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:59.341
Sure. So what does your mom say?

356
00:16:59.351 --> 00:17:03.143
She says that the pre-nup
is a little, uh, unconscionable.

357
00:17:05.351 --> 00:17:06.925
- Uh-huh.
- That's a legal term.

358
00:17:06.935 --> 00:17:09.300
I don't care.

359
00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:11.050
Fine.

360
00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:12.518
We can look it over.

361
00:17:14.977 --> 00:17:16.050
OK.

362
00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:17.925
Guess I just got Wamsgansed, huh?

363
00:17:17.935 --> 00:17:21.226
(LAUGHS) What can I say?
She's a hard-ass.

364
00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:28.759
So, me, you, and Roman make three.

365
00:17:28.769 --> 00:17:31.091
That's three more for a majority.

366
00:17:31.101 --> 00:17:33.300
Ewan is never there, so he's not voting.

367
00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:35.050
Even if he did, he hates Dad.

368
00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:39.133
- What about Gerri?
- Gerri. Dreaming.

369
00:17:39.143 --> 00:17:42.050
But I think, yeah,

370
00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:44.050
if there's no Ewan,

371
00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:45.800
- Fuck.
- looking at the numbers...

372
00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:46.925
yeah.

a couple of doubters, yeah.

Has any CEO ever survived a
successful vote of no confidence?

378
00:18:02.101 --> 00:18:04.925
You know, honestly, I think he
might be looking for a way out.

379
00:18:04.935 --> 00:18:06.560
So are we doing this?

380
00:18:07.462 --> 00:18:09.800
Don't ask me. He's your father.

381
00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:11.894
I'd be doing it for him.

I don't even want a parachute.

to go to the office today, is that cool?

Uh, he's resting, I guess.

I drove 500 miles,
and he can't come downstairs?

No, I shouldn't say it.

520

Oh, OK, you wanna talk about how we
only fuck once every six months?

00:45:58.310 --> 00:46:00.800
- Fuck you. You got plenty.
- You don't wanna talk about that?

966
00:46:00.810 --> 00:46:02.133
That's not fun to talk about?

- So you shot it?
- It was a joke.

00:53:02.101 --> 00:53:03.508
It's OK.

1115
00:53:03.518 --> 00:53:07.383
- (WHIMPERING)
- It's OK.

1116
00:53:07.393 --> 00:53:10.341
MARCIA:
It's OK, it's OK.

1117
00:53:10.351 --> 00:53:12.216
- You're OK?
- LOGAN: Yeah, I'm good.

1118
00:53:12.226 --> 00:53:14.675
- (DOOR OPENS)
- GERRI: Hey.

1119
00:53:14.685 --> 00:53:17.675
Hey, Gerri.

1120
00:53:17.685 --> 00:53:21.258
So what was Ewan talking about
earlier, Ken?

1121
00:53:21.268 --> 00:53:23.425
Ewan? Uh...

1122
00:53:23.435 --> 00:53:24.967
I don't know.

1123
00:53:24.977 --> 00:53:27.550
I mean, everyone's pretty upset.

1124
00:53:27.560 --> 00:53:29.341
I wouldn't take any notice.

1125
00:53:29.351 --> 00:53:31.769
Why was he so mad at you?

1126
00:53:34.310 --> 00:53:36.091
At me? Uh, I don't know.

1127
00:53:36.101 --> 00:53:40.550
Just the usual family hatred you get
at Thanksgiving. You know how it is.

1128
00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:42.925
I love your dad.

1129
00:53:42.935 --> 00:53:45.967
Personally, I will
always be there for him.

1130
00:53:45.977 --> 00:53:50.884
- He's a great man.
- Yeah, well... you're here.

1131
00:53:50.894 --> 00:53:54.133
I work for Waystar, not Logan Roy.

1132
00:53:54.143 --> 00:53:56.685
Are you thinking of moving against him?

1133
00:53:58.226 --> 00:54:00.258
Because if you are...

1134
00:54:00.268 --> 00:54:02.800
I've spoken to Frank,

1135
00:54:02.810 --> 00:54:04.935
and I've seen all I need to see.

1136
00:54:07.977 --> 00:54:09.268
Good night.

1137
00:54:16.643 --> 00:54:19.810
(MUSIC PLAYING)

1138
00:54:43.685 --> 00:54:46.019
(MUSIC PLAYING)

1139
00:55:07.185 --> 00:55:09.842
Let's take this off.

1140
00:55:09.852 --> 00:55:12.550
Here. Give me your arm.

1141
00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:14.675
Great.

1142
00:55:14.685 --> 00:55:16.518
All right.

1143
00:55:20.518 --> 00:55:21.643
Right.

1144
00:55:24.769 --> 00:55:26.508
Your shoe.

1145
00:55:26.518 --> 00:55:29.133
I went to the market...

1146
00:55:29.143 --> 00:55:33.175
and I bought a potato...

1147
00:55:33.185 --> 00:55:35.592
a new hat,

1148
00:55:35.602 --> 00:55:37.550
a pony,

1149
00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:42.216
a big fat hen,

1150
00:55:42.226 --> 00:55:44.175
and this.

1151
00:55:44.185 --> 00:55:47.050
That's right, Logan.

1152
00:55:47.060 --> 00:55:49.050
That's great.

1153
00:55:49.060 --> 00:55:51.477
Mmm. (LAUGHS)
